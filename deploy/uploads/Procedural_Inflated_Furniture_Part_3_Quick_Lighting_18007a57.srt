1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,580
 I think I'm going to use this one here in the middle.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,860
 It's the one that looks the best.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,720
 So let's try to use a backdrop. That's very useful.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,240
 I'm honestly going to make a quick, simple setup in a studio setting

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,540
 because an interior is going to be probably too much for these chairs.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,160
 We could, but I don't think it's worth it.

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,260
 So for example, as you can see, I was simulating in the normal,

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,940
 regular scale from Cinema 4D.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,340
 And now that I'm putting it in the backdrop,

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,260
 I'm going to actually scale it so it makes sense in real life.

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,440
 So right now, our main cube is 2 meters,

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:45,500
 and I want the piece to be roughly 8 centimeters tops in every way.

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,140
 So, well, actually, I'm too good. I already made it.

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,380
 Yeah, let's try to put some...

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,420
 It's going to be a little bit hard to show

16
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,000
 because the shape has too much integral details.

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,080
 So maybe something that can work.

18
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,900
 It's like all the fun stuff is happening here.

19
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,180
 So if you do a frontal, it's going to be cool,

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,100
 but it looks a little bit like an ass too.

21
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,740
 So let's try and work with this.

22
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,530
 It's hard because it looks a little bit big in terms of scale.

23
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,950
 Make this a disk.

24
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,810
 I want to create a really flat view.

25
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,470
 Not flat, but a strong image of this shape that we have.

26
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,259
 Let's put some material.

27
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,840
 Honestly, right away, I imagined this motherfucker to be super glossy.

28
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,050
 Make it pink.

29
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,340
 Let's actually make it super soft,

30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,660
 and then we are going to add a coat layer to it,

31
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,480
 so it reflects more.

32
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,810
 Now we actually duplicate the light and give it a little bit more.

33
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,550
 So we have that.

34
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,370
 Maybe we can...

35
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
 It's looking great.

36
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,980
 The shape itself is super weird.

37
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,380
 I will admit that it looks like a chewing gum.

38
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,440
 Chewing gum, sorry.

39
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,160
 Definitely we need to get something like this kind of angle.

40
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,820
 But we can try and make it super wide.

41
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,860
 I think that's going to be beneficial for this shape.

42
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,540
 It looks more underground in a way.

43
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,340
 You can make it feel really huge this way.

44
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,650
 I think this is the winning angle.

45
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,430
 Maybe we can give a little color to the ground.

46
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,820
 So this is the weird collection of furniture that we created.

47
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,100
 I also have a sofa laying around. Well, a sofa.

48
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,420
 Whatever the fuck this is.

49
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,500
 Which is also looking great.

50
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,960
 But I couldn't fit them all in frame.

51
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,380
 So I just removed it.

52
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,360
 Hope you guys enjoyed. Let me know if you have any questions.

53
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,500
 And I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye bye.
