1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,440
 Let's make some cool furniture 与 simulations.

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,040
 So I'm going to 开始 by making a 平面 so we can have a 碰撞体 there.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,760
 I'm going to 隐藏 the 摄像机 because I don't want that to bother me 右 now.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,180
 右 now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to 创建 something that feels organic and abstract.

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:29,760
 Imagine that you 回车键 a museum and you see a big sofa that's in the 进入 hall.

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,900
 So that's what we're going to do.

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,340
 And then 之后 that maybe we can 目标点 doing something that feels a little more grounded in reality in a way.

8
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,800
 Something like an armchair for example.

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,500
 So what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab a 样条.

10
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,420
 Let's go to 顶视图.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,700
 By the way, I still miss the icons for that stuff.

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,420
 Let's make a 快速 样条.

13
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:00,260
 I'm not going to get too much into 细节 because we'll probably refine it anyway.

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,180
 Let's 后退 to 透视.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,100
 I don't want to see 灯光, I don't want to see anything.

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,380
 Let's 移动 it a little bit 朝向 the middle.

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,440
 Yeah, it's not looking that bad.

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,580
 Nothing to worry 关于 at this moment.

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,700
 So let's 翻转 this bad boy.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,760
 Let's 添加 a 圆形.

21
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,500
 And well, we have this.

22
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,380
 And you'll think this is useless.

23
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,680
 Well, it is now.

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,620
 Let's try to 添加 some cups.

25
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,800
 Sorry, the dog is barking in the 背景.

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,220
 So everything is more rounded.

27
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:47,640
 Honestly, I'm not too worried 关于 intersections here because I would probably put this into a borderline 破碎/分裂 anyway.

28
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,160
 But I'm worried 关于 this part here.

29
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,520
 Let's make it a 柔和 插值.

30
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,860
 Honestly, I'm just going to tweak it a little bit because...

31
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:13,020
 I don't know. I kind of like it when it collides because once you drop it into the 体积网格, it looks like it has some kind of wrinkles in a way.

32
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:28,730
 Yeah, we don't have to worry 关于 it being too 关闭 because 与 the 模拟, it's eventually going to 扩大.

33
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,990
 So let's drop this into a borderline 破碎/分裂.

34
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,610
 And yeah, we have this kind of 模式, which is not exactly what we are looking for.

35
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,250
 右 now, I'm going to try and 使用 it 与 this 点 生成器 分配.

36
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:50,650
 I don't want to have a lot of cuts because the more we have, the less realistic it's going to look.

37
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,230
 So let's go for three.

38
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:59,090
 And let's 偏移 the fragments a little bit so we have some spacing in between them.

39
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,480
 So, okay, I think this can work.

40
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,620
 Let's just keep moving forward.

41
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,960
 Let's remerge that.

42
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,660
 So we are starting to have more quad 几何.

43
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,660
 Even though it's not perfect, it will probably work for our purposes.

44
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,960
 We could either 细分 it here a bit more.

45
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,440
 I think I'm going to actually do 两者.

46
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,680
 And then maybe we need to actually 细分 it here too.

47
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,660
 But maybe not as much.

48
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,680
 Let's give it a go 与 this and see how it looks.

49
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,100
 So we are going to go and simulate this.

50
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,240
 Let's put a cloth of somebody.

51
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,980
 Let's try 与 the cloth.

52
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,500
 Because we actually need it to be a balloon.

53
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,660
 And we need to 添加 some overpressure so it grows.

54
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,640
 Go 到帧 zero.

55
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,320
 I think it works.

56
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,360
 This is actually a little bit of a bummer.

57
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,640
 If you have this 禁用, it won't work.

58
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,320
 Okay, looks like shit.

59
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,180
 Let's 添加 a 碰撞体 to the 地面.

60
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,870
 It's not looking as bad.

61
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,270
 Trust me, it could be worse.

62
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:31,590
 I think that maybe we have a lot of overpressure and it's happening too 快速 maybe.

63
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,290
 So maybe we are going to need 75 帧.

64
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,290
 Let's try 与 something that feels subtler for now.

65
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,090
 Okay.

66
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,950
 Yeah, that's a little bit better.

67
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,940
 Actually, you know what?

68
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,820
 Maybe it will be worth...

69
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,260
 What's going on here?

70
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,040
 Okay, this is 从不 going to work.

71
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,600
 Well, we have this done.

72
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,680
 We'll 适合 it in a 秒.

73
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,160
 But what I'm going to do is I'm going to 移除 the 重力.

74
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,820
 And we need to check this motherfucker.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,460
 So remember everything that I said 关于 that corner looking great and blah blah?

76
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,220
 Well, we actually need to 适合 it.

77
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,520
 Okay, let's try again.

78
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,460
 Okay, this is better.

79
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,100
 Without any 重力, it's going to be just better to simulate it.

80
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,240
 But as you can see, things are going away.

81
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,370
 It's a fun 模拟, but absolutely worthless as it is 右 now.

82
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,810
 So what we need to do is that we need to 添加 some mixed 动画.

83
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,670
 And what I like to do is I put it by 强度.

84
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,790
 And if you 选集 it to just one, it will try to keep its 放置.

85
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:57,690
 So as you can see now, everything stays in the same 放置, which is really cool.

86
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,900
 And maybe we can 开始 experimenting 与 this if we want to get some wrinkles and stuff like that.

87
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,220
 Well, we are getting this abstract 形状.

88
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:23,100
 Honestly, not a fan of it 右 now, but one thing that we can and we should do...

89
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,820
 第一 of all, let's put the 目标 长度 a little bit higher so we get more wrinkles too.

90
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,270
 I think this is going to do too much, but we have to try.

91
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,470
 Well, yeah, but we 开始 to get some more wrinkles here and there.

92
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,390
 It's true that maybe we need some more 几何.

93
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,030
 So let's try to actually get rid of the 细分曲面.

94
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,870
 We will probably need it later, but once we have simulated.

95
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:13,720
 Of course, more 多边形 means it's going to be slower, but the 分辨率 of the 模拟 is going to be more realistic.

96
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,960
 Yeah, 第一 帧 are looking worse, but we are getting much more 细节 everywhere.

97
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,660
 And this is starting to look much, much cooler.

98
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:36,080
 One thing that we can do actually, it's in 次序 to simulate where people will actually sit.

99
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:46,900
 I like to put a 碰撞体 on top, which is going to be 不可见, but it's going to be useful to 创建 more of a sitting 区域 on 上.

100
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,520
 And let's say we like it there.

101
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,540
 As you can see, this way we are starting to get something that can be actually used as an abstract sofa or something like that.

102
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,120
 Probably we have to 添加 an 边 here.

103
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,120
 That's why it's causing that.

104
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,600
 So maybe we can try and 添加 a little bit more 圆角 just so things are a little bit smoother everywhere.

105
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,280
 Let's 隐藏 this marker.

106
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,390
 Yeah, you can see th@Part is much better now.

107
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:48,050
 And this stuff can be actually 细分 now.

108
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,770
 And we have this kind of organic.

109
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,810
 Probably the 下 of it is also looking really cool.

110
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,050
 We have these really, really cool 形状 with a lot of 细节.

111
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,990
 And these are looking amazing.

112
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,950
 And this can actually be applied to any kind of 形状.

113
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:10,090
 I'm just doing it in this abstract way because I found that the results are a little bit cooler.

114
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,210
 But yeah, it's a really abstract and cool looking sofa.

115
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,530
 I have to say I love it. I really love it.

116
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,930
 So the cool thing 关于 this is that it's quite 程序.

117
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:27,770
 So I'm going to duplicate this and make sure that I 禁用 the simulations.

118
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:33,230
 And the cool thing is that we can make whatever we want 与 it.

119
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:38,870
 So if we want to 开始 moving things around, it's going to crash because it's C4d.

120
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,470
 It's on me, actually. I have a lot of stuff.

121
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,950
 So we have the boron refractory, which we can still 编辑.

122
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,140
 And we can try as many different 形状 as we want.

123
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,060
 Well, this part here is looking really lovely.

124
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:10,840
 Mostly this part here goes back that, but well, probably because of this reason.

125
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,100
 So what we can do is actually put this inside a 体积...

126
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,060
 What am I doing?

127
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,160
 体积生成器 and a volume measure.

128
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,450
 Let's give it more... not space, but 分辨率.

129
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,870
 And we can try and see this, how it looks.

130
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,240
 We have more triangles 右 now, so the 模拟 is way, way more organic.

131
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:41,040
 But it kind of mimics a 生长 模拟, which is also really fucking sick.

132
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,480
 It's a little bit disgusting, too.

133
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,060
 Wow, so sick.

134
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,800
 I'm going to grab a still of this.

135
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,550
 Lovely. Disgusting, but lovely.

136
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,810
 And if we 细分 it, it's going to be a little bit tighter, but let's see.

137
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,110
 Yeah, it's a little bit unbearable to work 与.

138
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,110
 But it creates a really, really organic 形状.

139
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,950
 And 目标点 this 下 part is looking so sick.

140
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,450
 I think it has actually skipped...

141
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:20,190
 Yeah, it has skipped the 地面 because I forgot to put the 碰撞体 there.

142
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,650
 But it's also cool what it's creating there.

143
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:27,130
 To be fair, it's quite... I have to 停止 looking at it.

144
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,110
 It looks disgusting.

145
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,690
 Yeah, too much 几何, but it's all 右.

146
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,690
 It's all 右.

147
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,690
 And the cool thing 关于 this technique is that you can apply it to this 样条.

148
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,150
 You can apply it to some cubes.

149
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,530
 But let's see it in a 秒.

150
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,830
 What I'm going to do now is I'm going to try and 使用 this...

151
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,020
 Let me see.

152
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,510
 I want to make this our 碰撞体, too.

153
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,730
 So maybe... let's see. Let's see how it works.

154
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,590
 Well, they disappear.

155
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,530
 Probably once we've added this...

156
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,950
 I'm going to put back ours.

157
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,370
 The 体积网格 maybe we need to tweak a little bit.

158
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,350
 Especially this one because that's the one that's creating all the wrinkles.

159
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,590
 Which again, they are looking good, but probably not what we're looking for at the moment.

160
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,660
 They get a little bit lost too 快速.

161
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,120
 What I'm going to try and do is I'm going to 使用 this 圆形.

162
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,240
 Oh, shit.

163
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,530
 It changes.

164
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,060
 We can 添加 a 平面 to make them a little bit bigger.

165
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,240
 This is just for testing purposes.

166
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,560
 But let's see how it looks.

167
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,240
 Again, we have a lot of issues here.

168
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:34,040
 These 其他 parts are looking great because we have these kind of chains that are keeping the 形状 together.

169
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,060
 But let's try, maybe we need to...

170
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,400
 Actually, also, let's do one thing.

171
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,020
 I'm going to 创建 an 实例 of this main 样条.

172
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,100
 And I'm going to 替换 it with the 秒 one that's creating this.

173
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:51,020
 So that way, if we 修改 one 样条, we just need to do it once.

174
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,540
 Let's try and make a more 法线 looking...

175
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,790
 Whatever this is.

176
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,650
 Let's 禁用 this too.

177
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,800
 And also the 网格重构, please.

178
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,290
 I'm thinking th@Probably we don't need the 网格重构 here.

179
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:16,350
 Because we are actually putting things inside the...

180
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,380
 The whole 图像, anyway.

181
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,690
 You see, it's respecting that 形状 a little bit.

182
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,450
 It's getting fucked 上 there.

183
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,610
 But honestly, I think that's like limitations from C4d.

184
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:49,970
 It's true that also these guys here don't have a lot of 分辨率 at all.

185
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,690
 Maybe they have a little bit more 几何.

186
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,910
 It won't be as bad.

187
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,890
 But well, to begin 与, they are even already colliding.

188
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,920
 禁用 poise, that's it.

189
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,080
 I don't know, I think it's looking really cool.

190
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:16,800
 I love it.

191
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,720
 Let's try some 其他 weird stuff.

192
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,660
 Let's 开始 to organize things a little bit.

193
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,380
 This is going to be B2.

194
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,000
 This is B1.

195
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:36,480
 总是 remember to 禁用 all your 动态 tags.

196
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,220
 Otherwise, everything is going to be simulated.

197
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,660
 For example, this stuff.

198
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,060
 Can't it be 禁用?

199
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,580
 That fucking sucks.

200
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,140
 Fucking sucks.

201
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,980
 Well, I'm going to just 移除 myself.

202
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,380
 And actually, if you 移除 the 体积 cursor, that's going to be better.

203
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,300
 Otherwise, it's going to 计算 it.

204
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,960
 And this is the 碰撞体 that we are using.

205
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,260
 This can be 全局, but I'm going to duplicate it 两者 times for this and this.

206
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,560
 Just so I can keep track exactly of everything that's going on.

207
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,390
 B1.

208
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:25,470
 Sadly, I need to 移除 the 碰撞体 tag.

209
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:32,490
 Let's try to do something that feels a little bit more 法线 in a way.

210
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,950
 Let me reuse this.

211
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,770
 The 第一 tag that we were using, I'm going to 启用 it.

212
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,590
 I'm just going to press hit to see how it is.

213
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,850
 Your 平均 looking cushion.

214
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:08,250
 Let's put it in a 体积 cursor.

215
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,369
 I'm going to try different 形状.

216
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:18,640
 Let's put this in a 对称 maybe, so we are saving some 时间.

217
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,099
 This looks like shit because it's too 低多边形.

218
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:34,420
 Actually, 右 now we are creating a 生长 效果 because we are 模拟 inside the volume cursor.

219
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,900
 This is actually also something cool to check.

220
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:48,000
 You are actually creating a 生长 效果 because we are 模拟 and then we are applying the 体积网格.

221
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:55,160
 It's cool, but I don't think C4d is there to be able to pull 上 these simulations.

222
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,110
 It's actually quite cool. It can look like a foam 模拟.

223
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:16,340
 At this moment it's also colliding 与 each 其他 because it's actually three different 形状.

224
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,220
 The 结果 is actually quite cool, but it's not what I was looking for.

225
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,160
 I was looking to 修改 this as a whole.

226
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:37,500
 The 平面 right now is not working well for that reason because we have some stuff outside.

227
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,040
 Let's try another 立方体 that we are going to put inside a folder.

228
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,360
 I'm putting this inside a folder because I like to keep things tidy.

229
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:55,960
 So every 时间 that I put something that I want to 减去, I can just put it inside of the folder and that's going to be much easier to work 与.

230
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,800
 Cool stuff. That's really cool.

231
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,740
 Let's keep adding 形状 to our weird looking sofa.

232
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:18,300
 As you can see 右 now for this process I'm not taking into consideration anything 关于 形状.

233
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:27,840
 I'm just keeping in mind proportions so I know that this could later on be applied to something real if needed.

234
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:37,900
 There you go. A nice inflated sofa.

235
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,220
 Probably we have too much of this audio. Sorry 关于 that.

236
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:53,950
 If you want things to look cleaner you can have these kind of 形状 that are looking super fun too.

237
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,180
 Otherwise these kind of 形状 are really 尖锐 to pull 上.

238
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:10,660
 I think 右 now this is not so beautiful but you can tweak things just to make it look a little bit more refined I guess.

239
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:21,380
 Now to be fair, I won't blame anyone but myself because the 形状 that I'm using is super ugly.

240
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,700
 It makes no sense at all.

241
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:35,300
 The proportions are all... well that's why I'm going to tweak it a little bit so we got something that looks a little bit more refined.

242
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,750
 Let's try something like this.

243
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,780
 I mean this is looking cooler.

244
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,060
 Let's 添加 a little bit more 压力.

245
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,200
 A little bit of this, a little bit of that.

246
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,200
 Love it. This is looking much better.

247
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:13,620
 And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to 使用 these 形状 that we have here and I'm going to 创建 some colliders to act like the 基础 of our chair.

248
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,200
 So for example if we duplicate these two...

249
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:33,840
 I mean this is going to be 尖锐 to give a little context like in real 生命.

250
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:40,120
 But we can definitely try to make it feel a little bit more grounded in reality.

251
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,070
 So yeah, let's do this for now.

252
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,870
 Maybe then we can 连接 things if we need.

253
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,920
 Let's see if it doesn't break.

254
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,280
 Okay, it broke.

255
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,580
 I think it worked at the beginning.

256
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:10,020
 Yeah, but then it totally ignored our...

257
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,940
 We have too much 压力 going on so let's try 与 three.

258
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,090
 It got absolutely ignored.

259
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,350
 Let me try to quickly...

260
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,330
 Actually, let me try.

261
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,820
 Yeah, I think it wasn't just working at all.

262
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,500
 We need to attack for each of them.

263
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,580
 Actually this one, I'm going to make it...

264
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:00,230
 And you can see you have this 形状 inside of this 其他 shape.

265
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,730
 It's just looking really cool.

266
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:09,150
 Well, I'm not a super fan of this 形状 because it looks a little bit stupid to be fair.

267
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,130
 But you can go ahead and also...

268
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,300
 I think I broke it.

269
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,280
 Yeah, I broke it.

270
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:26,260
 I broke it because now this is our initial 几何, but well, it doesn't really matter.

271
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,830
 So, for example, maybe what we can do 右 now, let's say this is our 形状.

272
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,970
 We can either put it like this or it's going to collide if it goes farther.

273
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,750
 But things are going crazy 右 now.

274
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,940
 And we need some more colliders there, that's for sure.

275
00:23:52,940 --> 00:24:03,470
 So let's try to bring back the 碰撞体.

276
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,390
 And I want to 烘焙 a 形状 out of this one.

277
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:09,430
 And I'm going to...

278
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,290
 Oops, what's happening here?

279
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,430
 Probably we have more colliders everywhere.

280
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:16,430
 Yeah, that sucks.

281
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,280
 Yeah, I think that works better.

282
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,030
 So maybe we don't want this huge 碰撞体.

283
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:34,850
 Let's try and put this in a way so we can 创建...

284
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,930
 Imagine this is a bench.

285
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:43,850
 And I want th@Part there to be this part here and this part here.

286
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:49,570
 So I can 创建 a sitting 区域 in 两者 places.

287
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,820
 Yeah, that's looking good.

288
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,320
 And let me get a still of this 形状.

289
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,040
 Maple and...

290
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,020
 Okay, so we have this as our 主要 starting 基础.

291
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:20,360
 Let's try to 适合 the 几何 a little bit.

292
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,100
 Maybe we can put a 平滑 on it.

293
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,800
 And have a little bit more 控制 on those wrinkles.

294
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,090
 You can see it was like this.

295
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:39,190
 Maybe the font 标签 itself could work anyway.

296
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,780
 But I think it can be used also.

297
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,120
 There's a 平滑 deformer.

298
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,320
 We have this weird sitting 区域.

299
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,340
 It's looking great.

300
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,960
 This 下 part is looking even cooler.

301
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,790
 And actually, I just had an idea.

302
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:09,650
 This can actually also be used for 3D printing as the kind of 形状 that it's creating.

303
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,330
 This can be used, for example, as a keyholder.

304
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,300
 Okay, I know that I'm not working in 缩放.

305
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,900
 But you can actually...

306
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,640
 This is your real-生命 size 关键帧.

307
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:37,040
 You can actually print this motherfucker and you have a full keyholder for your plot.

308
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,040
 As I'm going to put the models there, feel 可用 to do 与 them whatever you want.

309
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,200
 That's what I like 关于 this kind of way of designing things.

310
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,280
 I actually don't need to think much.

311
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,280
 I'm just experimenting 与 it.

312
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,880
 And whatever that comes out works for me.

313
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,360
 If I'm making a sofa, let's say...

314
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,320
 I'm 总是 making a sofa just to 显示 the technique.

315
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:07,300
 But if I'm making a sofa and then I come 上 与 this idea...

316
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:14,840
 This is actually a fucking win because it's actually even a cooler idea than the previous one, you know?

317
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,260
 Well, yeah.

318
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,840
 It's enough for the struggles a little bit.

319
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,920
 It's very useful to 放置 things correctly.

320
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:27,200
 But you can see it can be quite a nice thing to have laying around in your flat.

321
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:27,880
 I love it.

322
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,260
 But that wasn't what I was planning to 显示.

323
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,340
 I was planning to 显示 how we can actually make this look more comfy.

324
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,520
 So, let's make another 立方体.

325
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,800
 And let's make a pillow out of this one.

326
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,100
 Let's 开始 with a 规律 sized one.

327
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,200
 I want to 使用 these guys as a 碰撞体.

328
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,100
 And...

329
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,140
 We need more 几何 here.

330
00:27:54,620 --> 00:28:01,340
 If you 选择 both press ctrl and 牵引场, you will 添加 more 部分 to each side.

331
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,000
 Let's put this as a 云.

332
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,540
 And...

333
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:07,660
 Oops.

334
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,230
 Sorry, there's already way too many.

335
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:24,210
 And you 创建 a fillet and then you give this some inflation.

336
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,220
 It will struggle because it's too 细薄.

337
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,060
 You give it a little more air.

338
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:38,900
 It still struggles because it's so 细薄 that you need to give it a little bit less 厚度.

339
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,940
 Let's try 与 5.

340
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:44,990
 Okay, yeah.

341
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,070
 It's breaking.

342
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,430
 Not sure why, but let's 查找 out.

343
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,290
 Probably let's try without 圆角.

344
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,820
 So, let's give it a little bit more 部分 here.

345
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,460
 And we need way more inflation.

346
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:05,950
 Cool.

347
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:11,510
 We have something that starts to look like a cushion.

348
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:15,330
 I want it to be a bit thinner though.

349
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,840
 Let me see if I can actually get it to work 与 圆角.

350
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,240
 Because I know that 圆角 helps...

351
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,180
 Well, fuck it.

352
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,240
 Well, more 几何 means that we need a little bit more inflation too.

353
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,620
 I don't know why it's doing that kind of motion.

354
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,400
 Maybe this 时间 we need some more 其他 通道.

355
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,660
 Let's put the 减震 a little bit higher.

356
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,890
 Yeah, that works better.

357
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:14,730
 So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually...

358
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:20,190
 第一 of all, I'm going to duplicate this motherfucker.

359
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,550
 I'm going to put it here.

360
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,560
 I'm going to 旋转 it a little bit to 创建 some more copies.

361
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,880
 Let's do something 与 it.

362
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:41,610
 Well, that one that I scaled 下, I'm not sure if I'm going to need to 更新 it.

363
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:46,390
 But let's go to the 模拟 settings and let's go to, for example, 边框 60.

364
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,730
 And here we are going to put the 重力 to be on.

365
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,250
 Two 帧 之前, it's going to be 关闭.

366
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:59,930
 This way we're going to get an inflation 动画 and then the cushions are going to go 下.

367
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:05,690
 So they become cushions then go 下.

368
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:11,230
 And this way you can actually, well, I think...

369
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,250
 It's not working because we have a 碰撞体 here.

370
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:25,730
 But I think it's super easy to solidly 生成 a lot of cushions.

371
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:31,230
 It's not working still because there's probably some 其他 hidden 碰撞体 over there.

372
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,190
 Colliding...

373
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,550
 These are not it.

374
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:37,690
 This one.

375
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,380
 Okay, now it finally works.

376
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,760
 But this is cool because you can actually 创建 a lot of them.

377
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,960
 I'm surprised by how well C4d handles this.

378
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,380
 Honestly, I would have 从不 expected it to work that well.

379
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,040
 I have a lot of them 右 now.

380
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,600
 It's going to break for a little bit, but as you can see, it's still working quite, quite well.

381
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,020
 So now they are inflated and they go 下.

382
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,980
 You can 创建 like a pillow party.

383
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,300
 So 与 this technique, I created this chair, for example, that you're seeing here on the 右.

384
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,400
 I just tried to resume it because this is how it was looking.

385
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,020
 And I think there's something wrong because this is my 基础 形状.

386
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:37,120
 These are my colliders, which are just basically like a 盒子 and a 盒子 inside a 立方体.

387
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,920
 I think it's currently not looking exactly the same.

388
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,940
 Ah, yeah, maybe it doesn't. Let's give it a go.

389
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:53,080
 So I did the same technique. I basically created a 基础 形状, which I was then inflating, and then it's colliding.

390
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:02,100
 But yeah, you know, C4d has this tendency of tweaking things.

391
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:08,300
 And suddenly when you open a file that you were working on from six months ago, suddenly it's not working.

392
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,900
 Yeah, this looks like shit. I'm not sure if the remix is going to get 固定.

393
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,960
 It's not. You see? It's like, well, you got a home and want to 次序 online.

394
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,220
 But yeah, this kind of 形状 and organicness looks really cool to me. I honestly quite love it.

395
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,900
 Being able to 创建 these abstract-looking, more organic 形状.
