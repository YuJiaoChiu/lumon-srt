1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So for example this is another thing that we can do. We have these two cubes that we have inside a boronoronefractor.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I think in this case I'm going to subdivide them so they are going to look a little bit more organic right away which is actually quite good.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And you can... this is our way of making like a procedural looking stuff.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's see if I remember... no this is not...

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Totally messed up but well who cares.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And then I put this inside a volume measure so everything is part of the same shape.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And this is the remeshed version is what I'm going to use as a simulation.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And you can quickly get these weird looking things.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
In this case the colliders and a half a half a lot of them.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
In this case I think I will benefit from not having this one here like that.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So let's see...

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Some moment in frame 22 when it packs up.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't know maybe I don't want this cube right now.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I want it to expand as much as it can at least in the edges.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yeah so I increase this nicely looking armchair.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Of course you have to have a big living room in order to put this chair but well.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And also let's get rid of...

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I want this one for the top part.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't want it for the bottom part.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's looking really nice.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Reminds me to a typography inspired piece or something like that.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is looking sick.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's scroll as steel.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I say I still just because I'm used to working animation but yeah this is looking dope.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Cool thing as I always say is that I can just go ahead and going to...

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is going to be B01.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Good.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I can't get that.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't want to move them that's why I'm not moving that to the right or the left.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But the cool thing now is that with the boronine fracture I have unlimited variations of these chairs.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So this is actually quite procedural.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
See I have another one.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Another one.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And yeah I honestly love this kind of workflows because it's basically you have infinite ways of generating new and new.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Generating new assets.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
For example we want to simplify the shapes a little bit.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We can do that.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
These shapes by itself are really quite interesting though.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So let's actually try to remove that collider too.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I want it to be full organic.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah it's way too abstract I guess.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Still not bad.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But what you can do.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's something that I normally do too.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let me get this blackboard here.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Definitely make it smaller.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What we can do is actually just animate it in white.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Here.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Here.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So this way we can make it grow.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And then flatten it a little bit whenever we want.

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It creates like this super cozy.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a weird looking thing too.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And let's make more variations.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I love this method.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Confia as fact.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Let's also try to make a new version.

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm going to try something different.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And instead of using this as our point generator.

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Well.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Right away we can actually just use what we had.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So for our normal looking sofa.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Looking cool anyway.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But that's not what I wanted to make.

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Let's quickly make.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I want to use the matrix as a source for our.

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
For our shapes.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But let me actually.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I want to see what I'm doing.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Because as you can see.

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And the matrix has a lot of clones.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And that's what's being used to generate our cuts.

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And as you can see.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You can also have this.

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Also procedural way of creating.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Sorry.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Creating geometry.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But you can.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Rotate it.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You can space them out.

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And it's creating a really.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Weird looking.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Look.

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
For example.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If you add more and one more cuts.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're only going to.

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Need to make them.

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I think it's going to break with this.

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Too many.

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And it will probably.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Don't look that good.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I think.

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I think this stuff.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Really benefits from being simple.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But you can add more.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
More detail to the simulations.

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
In this way.

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's looking.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Very cool too.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So let's put some light on.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
One of them.
